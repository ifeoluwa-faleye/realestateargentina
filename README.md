# realestateargentina
In this project, the focus is the real estate sector in Argentina, I will be creating a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In this project, we are working for a client who wants to create a model that can predict the price of apartments in the city of Buenos Aires â€” with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400,000 USD

Some of the key things I will be doing in this project are:

Creating a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
Building a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
Improving model performance by reducing overfitting.
Creating a dynamic dashboard for interacting with your completed model.
